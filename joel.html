it popular as a dummy text in the 1960s, although McClintock says he remembers
 coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal type samples.
 So far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the popularity
 of Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory that the filler text
 has been used for centuries.</p>
